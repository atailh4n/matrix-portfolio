This is a portfolio website built with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) and designed with [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)

I did it for educational purposes and you can copy it and tweak!

**Also it has latest TailwindCSS (v4 in current time) so don't need to worry about the drama of Tailwind and shadcn. I gave 4 hours just to fix broken packages. I hope a llama chases the Tailwind developers while they're thirsty and hungry in the middle of the Sahara Desert after v4 change.**
